plugins
=======

This repo is an attempt to get plugins into a more organized state and make them easier to 
contribute to and find, especially if they aren't in the core.

Please submit your plugin in its own folder with a header which clearly states its licence 
(MIT or less restrictive), how to use it, how to install it, the last version of Pyblosxom 
it was tested on, and some form of contact method so we can reach you if there are any questions.

If you are unsure about anything, check the example plugin (which is a real plugin, just part 
of the core and not an extra plugin) and/or contact us using any of the methods listed 
here: http://pyblosxom.github.com/
